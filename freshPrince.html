        <h1>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</h1>
        <p>From western Philadelphia I hail
            where in my youth I'd play upon the green
            'til - rue the day! -I found myself assail'd
            by ruffians contemptible and mean.
            Although the spat was trivial and brief,
            it wounded my dear other deep within;
            and so, to give her conscience sweet relief,
            she sent me forth to live amongst her kin.
            When to my port of call I'd been conveyed,
            I came upon a coachman most unique;
            and yet, I simply took the trip and paid,
            despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique.
            I survey all the land with princely mien
            in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene. </p>
